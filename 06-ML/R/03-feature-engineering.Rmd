# Prerequisites 

```{r}
# Helper packages
library(tidyverse)
library(naniar)

# Modeling process
library(tidymodels)
```

```{r}
# Ames housing data
ames = read_csv("./00-data/ML/ames.csv")

# create training/test split
set.seed(123)
split  <- initial_split(ames, prop = 0.7, strata = "Sale_Price")
train  <- training(split)
test   <- testing(split)
```

# Target engineering 

```{r engineering-y_log}
# log transformation
ames_recipe <- recipe(Sale_Price ~ ., data = train) %>%
  step_log(all_outcomes())

ames_recipe
```

# Dealing with missingness

## Visualizing missing values 

```{r}
ames_raw <- read_csv("../data/ames_raw.csv")

# total missing values
sum(is.na(ames_raw))
```

```{r, fig.width=9}
# can you identify patterns of missing data?
# missingness is represented with black
vis_miss(ames_raw)
```

```{r, fig.height=6}
# which features have most missing?
gg_miss_var(ames_raw)
```


## Imputation 

### Estimated statistic 

```{r engineering-mean-impute, eval=FALSE}
# median imputation to all features
a <- ames_recipe %>%
  step_medianimpute(all_predictors())

# median imputation to just numeric predictors
b <- ames_recipe %>%
  step_medianimpute(all_predictors(), all_numeric())

# median imputation to 1 or more features
c <- ames_recipe %>%
  step_medianimpute(Gr_Liv_Area)
```


### K-nearest neighbor 

```{r engineering-knn-impute}
knn_imp <- ames_recipe %>%
  step_knnimpute(all_predictors(), neighbors = 6)
```

### Tree-based {.tabset}

```{r engineering-bagging-impute}
ames_recipe %>%
  step_bagimpute(all_predictors())
```


# Feature filtering 

```{r}
nzv <- ames_recipe %>%
  step_nzv(all_predictors(), unique_cut = 10) # threshold as % (10%)
```

# Numeric feature engineering

## Skewness 

```{r engineering-normalizing}
# Normalize all numeric features
X_norm <- ames_recipe %>%
  step_YeoJohnson(all_predictors(), all_numeric())                 
```

## Standardization {.tabset}

```{r engineering-standardizing-recipes}
# standardize all numeric features
std <- ames_recipe %>%
  step_center(predictors(), all_numeric()) %>%
  step_scale(predictors(), all_numeric())
```


# Categorical feature engineering

## One-hot & dummy encoding {.tabset}

```{r engineering-tbd2}
# one-hot encode
ohe <- ames_recipe %>%
  step_dummy(all_nominal(), one_hot = TRUE)

# dummy encode
de <- ames_recipe %>%
  step_dummy(all_nominal(), one_hot = FALSE)
```


## Label encoding 

```{r}
# Label encode a single column
lbl <- ames_recipe %>%
  step_integer(MS_SubClass)
```

## Ordinal encoding 

```{r}
# specify levels in order
lvls <- c("Very_Poor", "Poor", "Fair", "Below_Average", "Average", "Typical", 
          "Above_Average", "Good", "Very_Good", "Excellent", "Very_Excellent")

# apply ordinal encoding to quality features
ord_lbl <- ames_recipe %>%
  # 1. convert quality features to factors
  step_string2factor(
    ends_with("Qual"), ends_with("QC"), ends_with("_Cond"),
    levels = lvls
    ) %>% 
  # 2. convert any missed levels (i.e. no_pool, no_garage,) to "None"
  step_unknown(
    ends_with("Qual"), ends_with("QC"), ends_with("_Cond"), 
    new_level = "None"
    ) %>%
  # 3. move "None" level to front ('None', 'Very_Poor', ..., 'Very_Excellent')
  step_relevel(
    ends_with("Qual"), ends_with("QC"), ends_with("_Cond"), 
    ref_level = "None"
    ) %>%
  step_integer(ends_with("Qual"), ends_with("QC"), ends_with("_Cond"))
```

## Lumping 

```{r}
# Lump levels for two features
rare_encoder <- ames_recipe %>%
  step_other(Neighborhood, threshold = 0.01, other = "other")
```


# Dimension reduction 

```{r engineering-pca}
pca_encoder <- ames_recipe %>%
  step_center(all_numeric()) %>%
  step_scale(all_numeric()) %>%
  step_pca(all_numeric(), threshold = .95)
```

# Proper implementation

First, let's create our

1. train/test split
2. resampling procedure
3. model object
4. hyperparameter grid

These items are nothing new and similar to our approach in the last module.

```{r}
# create train/test split
set.seed(123)  # for reproducibility
split  <- initial_split(ames, prop = 0.7)
train  <- training(split)
test   <- testing(split)

# create resampling procedure
kfold <- vfold_cv(train, v = 10)

# model object
knn <- nearest_neighbor(neighbors = tune()) %>%
  set_engine("kknn") %>%
  set_mode("regression")

# Create grid of hyperparameter values
hyper_grid <- expand.grid(neighbors = seq(2, 25, by = 1))
```

Next, we create our model and feature engineering recipe with the 6 steps mentioned above.

```{r}
# model recipe with feature engineering steps
model_form <- recipe(Sale_Price ~ ., data = train) %>%
  # 1. Remove near-zero variance features that are categorical 
  step_nzv(all_nominal()) %>%
  # 2. Ordinal encode our quality-based features
  step_string2factor(
    ends_with("Qual"), ends_with("QC"), ends_with("_Cond"),
    levels = lvls
    ) %>% 
  step_unknown(
    ends_with("Qual"), ends_with("QC"), ends_with("_Cond"), 
    new_level = "None"
    ) %>%
  step_relevel(
    ends_with("Qual"), ends_with("QC"), ends_with("_Cond"), 
    ref_level = "None"
    ) %>%
  step_integer(ends_with("Qual"), ends_with("QC"), ends_with("_Cond")) %>%
  # 3. Center and scale (i.e., standardize) all numeric features
  step_center(all_numeric(), -all_outcomes()) %>%
  step_scale(all_numeric(), -all_outcomes()) %>%
  # 4. Perform dimension reduction by applying PCA to all numeric features.
  step_pca(all_numeric(), -all_outcomes(), num_comp = 30) %>%
  # 5. Collapse categorical levels with small representation
  step_other(all_nominal(), threshold = 0.01, other = "other") %>%
  # 6. One-hot encode the remaining categorical features.
  step_dummy(all_nominal(), one_hot = TRUE)
```

Now we can run `tune_grid` and supply it all our objects. This is where the feature engineering actually happens as `tune_grid` will apply the feature engineering steps individually within each of the kfold resamples so there is no data leakage.

```{r, fig.height=3, fig.width=6, fig.align='center'}
# Tune a knn model using grid search
results <- tune_grid(knn, model_form, resamples = kfold, grid = hyper_grid)

# best model
show_best(results, metric = "rmse")

# plot results
results %>%
  collect_metrics() %>%
  filter(.metric == "rmse") %>%
  ggplot(aes(neighbors, mean)) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_point() +
  labs(x = "k", y = "RMSE", title = "Cross validated grid search results")
```

# Exercises

Using the Ames dataset and the same approach shown in the last section:

1. Rather than use a 70% stratified training split, try an 80% unstratified training split. How does your cross-validated results compare?

2. Rather than numerically encode the quality and condition features (i.e. `step_integer(matches("Qual|Cond|QC"))`), one-hot encode these features.  What is the difference in the number of features in your training set?  Apply the same cross-validated KNN model to this new feature set. How does the performance change? How does the training time change?

3. Identify three new feature engineering steps that are provided by [recipes](https://recipes.tidymodels.org/), [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/preprocessing.html#preprocessing) or some other open source R/Python package:
   - Why would these feature engineering steps be applicable to the Ames data?
   - Apply these feature engineering steps along with the same cross-validated KNN model. How do your results change?
   
4. Compare the Python and R preprocessing steps in the last section. Can you spot any discrepancies? If so, resolve them so the pipelines are performing the same steps.
   
4. Using the [Attrition data set](https://misk-data-science.github.io/misk-homl/docs/01-introduction.nb.html#the_data_sets), assess the characteristics of the target and features.
   - Which target/feature engineering steps should be applied?
   - Create a feature engineering pipeline and apply a KNN grid search. What is the performance of your model?
